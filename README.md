## Limitations

- :no_entry_sign: **Working forms**
    - :pushpin: Though the first iteration of the website was built to be responsive, with a mobile-first philosophy, it currently lacks many interactive features commonly found in modern webpages. It is a static website and the form fields are not functioning yet. The form's do not have the capability to capture, store, or retrieve data from users yet.
